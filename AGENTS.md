# Project

The LiteLLM Operator is a Kubernetes charm for the [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) proxy, an OpenAI-compatible gateway to many LLM providers. `README.md` is the operator documentation and `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the human contributor guide. The knowledge base above is the agent's guide, and `requirements/` holds the behavior each feature commits to.

The charm has no implementation yet. The first feature's base pull request adds `.kb/architecture.md`.
